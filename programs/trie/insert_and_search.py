Problem

    Trie is an effecient information retrieval data structure. Using this data
    structure to store Strings and Search strings. Your task is to use TRIE
    data structure and search the given string A. If found print 1 else 0.

Input

    The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of
    test cases. Then T test cases follow each test case consists of three
    lines. First line of each test case consist of a integer N, denoting the
    number of element in a Trie to be stored.

    Second line of each test case consists of N space seperated strings
    denoting the elements to be stored in the trie.

    Third line of each test case consists of a String A to be searched in the
    stored elements.

Output

    Print the respective output in the respective line.

Constraints

    * 1 <= T <= 20
    * 1 <= N <= 20
